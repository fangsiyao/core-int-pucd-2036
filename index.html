<P>Im the sophomore student study in The New School. My major is Communication design. I choose this major because I would like to create different compositions which not only makes people feel good looking, but also could reach the purpose of expressing ideas in this world under a quick pace.</P>

<P>Since the pandemic, I spending the whole semester at home and studying the online courses. I could count who many times I hang out during this summer, and the rest of the time I start to play some video games. But I want to finish the way of staying home all the time, and starts to go out and feeling the outside world.</P>
